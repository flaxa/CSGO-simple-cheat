# CSGO simple cheat


This is a simple CSGO cheat that will not be updated. The offsets is all that needs to be changed. All values such as FOV for the aimbot are hard coded and can be easily changed. This is an old project of an external cheat and will probably never be updated again unless there is compelling reason.



## Features

- Triggerbot
